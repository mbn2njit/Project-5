# Android Project 5 - Calorie Counter

Submitted by: **Your Name Here**

Calorie Counter is a health metrics app that allows users to track the amount of calories of food someone consumes a day, in addition to the amount of protein.

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **At least one health metric is tracked (based on user input)**
  - Chosen metric(s): Calories, g of Protein
- [x] **There is a "create entry" UI that prompts users to make their daily entry**
- [x] **New entries are saved in a database and then updated in the RecyclerView**
- [x] **On application restart, previously entered entries are preserved (i.e., are *persistent*)**
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] **Create a UI for tracking averages and trends in metrics**
- [ ] **Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring**
- [ ] **Implement orientation responsivity**
- [ ] **Add a daily photo feature**

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
I added safeguards to the input mechanisms of the name, calorie count, and protein counts, so they can't be empty.

## Notes

This project was potentially the hardest of them all, it felt very intimidating to even start it.
